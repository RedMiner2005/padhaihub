# PadhaiHub

PadhaiHub - an app that campus students can use to chat and share notes as PDFs with each other.
Notes can be shared on personal one-to-one chats as well as on a public forum.

## Implementation

The app is meant to allow for realtime chatting and file sharing.
Tech stack used along with Flutter:
1. Backend
   * [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com):
     * OAuth login for authentication
     * Realtime streams for messages
     * Provides storage for PDFs.
     * Host cloud functions (say, for listening to changes in chats and pushing notifications)
     * [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging): In case push notifications are implemented, FCM will be set up for the project.
   * [Personal Notification Service](https://padhaihub-service.onrender.com) hosted on [Render](https://render.com)
     * Simple GET-request based Web service to push notifications.
     * Manually called everytime a message is sent
     * Source code can be found on my [repo](https://github.com/RedMiner2005/padhaihub-service).
2. Client Logic
   * Firebase for Flutter: To integrate Firebase with the app, incl. the core package, Firestore, Firebase Auth, Firebase Storage, [firebase_ui_firestore](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_ui_firestore) 
   * [firebase-messaging](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_messaging): For setting up FCM on the client side, separately mentioned as it is optional
   * [bloc](https://bloclibrary.dev/): For state management on the client side
3. UI/UX
   * [animations](https://pub.dev/packages/animations) and [flutter_staggered_animations](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_staggered_animations): For the container transform animations
   * [flutter_chat_ui](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_chat_ui/): Along with the sister package [flutter_firebase_chat_core](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_firebase_chat_core), it provides a complete UI and integration with Firebase for chats.
